## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by Aurélien Géron. This repository contains Python code implementations for the various chapters of the book, providing practical examples and exercises related to machine learning and deep learning.

The code demonstrates concepts such as:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Sequence Processing**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) with RNN**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- **And more!**

Each script corresponds to a chapter from the book, allowing you to follow along with hands-on examples and deepen your understanding of the material.
